# Leap Year
![alt text](https://nastassjamotro.github.io/Programming-2-Portfolio/img/isLeapYear.png)

This is a program made using Java. It takes in any year after 1582 from the user and checks to see if it's a leap year or not. If the user enters a year before 1582, it will show an error and tell the user if they want to try again. After each prompt for a year and each answer if the year given is in fact a leap year or not, the program will ask if the user wants to try again which should be answered by entering in 'y' or 'n'.
