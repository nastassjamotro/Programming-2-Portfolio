# PacMan Game
![alt text](https://nastassjamotro.github.io/Programming-2-Portfolio/img/PacMan.png)

This is a simple game of PacMan made using Java and Java Swing to display the GUI. Press 's' to start the game. You can move pacman around using the arrow keys on the keyboard. The ghosts move around in seemingly random directions and just like the original game, if pacman touches one of the ghosts, you lose. There are three lives and after each life is gone, the game restarts. You win the game by collecting all the dots that are located around the board and once you do so, the game restarts.
