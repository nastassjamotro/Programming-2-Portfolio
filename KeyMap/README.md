# Key Map

This is another Java made program that makes a combo of letters from a set of numbers. The program takes in any 5 digit number and then gives you back "words" based on the corresponding or aligning letters. It's supposed to somewhat replicate how the letters are lined up on a phone keypad and what word can be made or spelled out when typing in a combo of numbers.
